						When he landed in Michigan in late May, all the weary little boy carried was a trash bag stuffed with dirty clothes from his dayslong trek across Mexico, and two small pieces of paper — one a stick-figure drawing of his family from Honduras, the other a sketch of his father, who had been arrested and led away after they arrived at the United States border in El Paso.

						An American government escort handed over the 5-year-old child, identified on his travel documents as José, to the American woman whose family was entrusted with caring for him. He refused to take her hand. He did not cry. He was silent on the ride “home.”

						The first few nights, he cried himself to sleep. Then it turned into “just moaning and moaning,” said Janice, his foster mother. He recently slept through the night for the first time, though he still insists on tucking the family pictures under his pillow.

				<p>The airport was deserted when José landed in Michigan on May 23 at around 12:30 a.m., and it was close to 2 a.m. by the time Janice drove up to the house with him in the back seat of her van.</p>
				<p>“He seemed very tired and confused, but was compliant,” Janice recalled.</p>

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>At first, José was sad and withdrawn. He did not initiate any interaction with the family, but followed directions from Janice, who speaks basic Spanish, to do things such as wash his hands and come to dinner.</p>

				<p>“For two days, he didn’t shower, he didn’t change his clothes. I literally had to peel the socks off his feet. They were so old and smelly,” Janice said. “I realized that he didn’t want anyone to take anything away from him.”</p>

					The one thing that animated him was discussing his “photos,” as he called the family drawings.

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">

					He introduced “mi familia,” pointing to the figures of his parents, brother and younger sister. Staring intensely at the sketch of his father, with a slight mustache and a cap, he repeated his name out loud again and again.

					In recent days, the boy began attending a multi-age kindergarten at Bethany with about a dozen other migrant children.

			</div>

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>
					A natural athlete, he started playing soccer and catch with Chris and Janelle, the couple’s 14-year-old younger daughter. His father taught him “fútbol,” he told them.

					By the beginning of week two with the family, he cracked some smiles and even allowed himself a few giggles.

					“It’s incredibly conflicting for me as a parent to watch this little boy begin to just have fun and experience joy in simple pleasures,” Janice said. “His dad doesn’t get to see him being joyful. It’s as if these moments with his son have been stolen from him. I am no substitute.”
				</p>

				<p>
					For sure, the boy’s family always seems to be on his mind.

					At bedtime one night last week, he announced: “I am going with my papá on Saturday.”

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">

					To which Janice responded, “You know, mi amor, I don’t think it will be Saturday. First we have to get more information about where your dad is so that we can call him, and then we’ll see.”

					Earlier this week, José spoke with his parents for the first time since their lives had diverged. The phone calls were separate: His father remains in detention, and his mother is in Honduras.
				</p>

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>
					The calls went smoothly, according to the case manager.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>
					But they changed everything. Somehow, it had sunk in that there was no way of knowing when he would see his family. “It triggered all the separation trauma again,” said Janice.

					She tried to offer him his toys, but he erupted in anger, screaming and crying at the kitchen table for almost an hour.

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>
					“It was really hard to watch. The look on his face was anguish,” said Janice, her voice breaking.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>
					When his fury subsided, the boy collapsed on the kitchen floor, still sobbing. “Mamá, Papá,” he said, over and over.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="rellax paragraph-text">
				<p>
					Nearby lay the family pictures, which he had flung on the floor.
